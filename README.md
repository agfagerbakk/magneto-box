# Magneto-box

### Project concept
The overall goal of the project is to confirm a proof of concept for a microcontroller-based sensor unit that can detect changes in the magnetic field of the Earth. This could be used, if the sensor can detect changes at high enough statistical accuracy to measure low-intensity irregularities caused by the Auroral Electrojet, a transport current in the polar ionosphere. If successful, a network of these units can collect data that could be used to create a three-dimensional model of transport currents around an area, which could be used to remove interference in trans-ionospheric radar measurements, or increase the significance of ionospheric EM-measurements.

### Technology
This project is based on the usage of a LoPy device, but can be used with any other microcontroller that can compile and run Python/Micropython.
#### Busses
The libraries written for the project all function on i2c busses.
