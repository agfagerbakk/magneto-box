"""
This function takes in two vectors (intended to be the accelerometer data and magnetometer data) with three dimensions.
It then finds the appropriate rotation matrix to rotate one vector (the accelerometer data) to [0,0,1], such that the entirety
of the force is pointed down. Then it applies this same rotation matrix to the magnetometer data, such that the positive 
Z-direction is inverse and parallell to the direction of gravity (which, in layman's terms means "up").
It can rotate any arbitrary vector in three dimensions to any arbitrary vector in three dimensions, unless they are parallell,
which will give a div by zero error.
